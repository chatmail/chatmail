# Chat-mail server development (up until Oct 18th)

## Dovecot goals/steps

1. create-user-on-login ("doveauth")

2. per-user quota (adaptive)

3. automatic expiry of messages older than M days

4. automatic expiry of users that haven't logged in for N days


## Filtermail

1. Only allow (outgoing) mails if secure-join or autocrypt-pgp-encrypted format.
   Currently only checks for "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----".

2. basic outgoing send rate/limits (depending on "account-rating")


## online tests (first with plain python/pytest)

- write tests for dovecot login (exists)
- write tests for postfix logins
- write A<>B send/receive tests


## Delta Chat

1. qr code that defines access to a chatmail instance (like mailadm but without http etc.)

2. support for creating username/password and verifying login works
